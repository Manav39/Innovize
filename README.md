# üéµSoundMint - Music NFT Copyright Protection

## **Overview**
This project provides a **blockchain-based NFT platform** to help **new and independent music artists** secure ownership of their work using **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**. The platform allows artists to **mint unique NFTs for their music** and **register copyrights transparently** on the blockchain, ensuring **ownership verification, prevention of piracy, and direct monetization**.

## **Problem Statement**
New artists face significant challenges in **copyright protection, ownership verification, and monetization** of their music. Traditional copyright processes are **expensive, slow, and inaccessible**. Additionally, piracy and unauthorized use threaten their intellectual property.

### **Challenges Faced by Artists:**
- **Expensive & Slow Copyright Registration** ‚Äì Traditional legal processes involve high costs and delays.
- **Ownership Disputes** ‚Äì Proving ownership of a song is difficult when plagiarism occurs.
- **Music Piracy** ‚Äì Unauthorized use and illegal downloads result in revenue loss.
- **Monetization Issues** ‚Äì Streaming platforms take a large share of artists' earnings.

## **Solution: Blockchain & NFTs**
Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the music industry by offering artists innovative ways to manage ownership, distribution, and monetization of their work. This project harnesses the power of **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** to provide a decentralized and secure platform for music copyright protection.

### **Key Features of the Solution:**

1. **Minting Music NFTs:** Artists can create unique digital tokens representing their music tracks. Each NFT serves as an immutable certificate of ownership, ensuring authenticity and originality.

2. **Transparent Copyright Registration:** Ownership records are securely stored on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and transparent method for copyright registration. This decentralization eliminates the need for intermediaries, giving artists more control over their creations.

3. **Prevention of Duplicate Registrations:** The system ensures that each song is minted as an NFT only once, preventing duplicate registrations and maintaining the exclusivity of each track.

4. **Direct Monetization Opportunities:** Artists can sell or license their music NFTs directly to fans and collectors without relying on traditional intermediaries. This direct-to-fan approach can lead to more equitable revenue distribution and closer artist-fan relationships.

### **Advantages Over Traditional Models:**

- **Enhanced Artist Control:** By leveraging blockchain, artists retain greater control over their work, from distribution to monetization, reducing reliance on record labels and streaming platforms.

- **Fractional Ownership and Investment:** Tokenization allows for the division of music rights into smaller, tradable units. Fans and investors can purchase fractions of a song's royalties, creating new investment opportunities and fostering a sense of shared ownership.

- **Increased Transparency:** Blockchain's immutable ledger provides clear and accessible records of ownership and transaction history, reducing disputes and ensuring all parties have access to the same information.

## **Smart Contract Implementation**
The **MusicNFT** smart contract is developed in **Solidity** and deployed on the **Ethereum blockchain**.

### **Key Features:**
‚úÖ **ERC721 Standard** ‚Äì Uses OpenZeppelin‚Äôs NFT standard for easy integration.  
‚úÖ **Ownership Verification** ‚Äì Stores metadata (song name, artist name, timestamp).  
‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention** ‚Äì Ensures the same song is not minted twice.  
‚úÖ **Event Emission** ‚Äì Notifies when a new NFT is minted.  
‚úÖ **Ownable Access Control** ‚Äì Only artists can mint their NFTs.  

### **Smart Contract Code:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract MusicNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter; 

    struct Song {
        string songName;
        string artistName;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Song) public songDetails; // Stores song metadata
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private existingSongs; // Prevents duplicate song minting
    mapping(uint256 => bool) private _mintedTokens; // Tracks minted tokens

    event MusicMinted(address indexed artist, uint256 tokenId, string songName, string artistName, uint256 timestamp);

    constructor() ERC721("MusicNFT", "MUSNFT") Ownable(msg.sender) {}

    /// @notice Mint an NFT for a music track
    /// @param songName The name of the song
    /// @param artistName The name of the artist
    /// @param metadataURI The IPFS URL of the song metadata
    function mintMusicNFT(string memory songName, string memory artistName, string memory metadataURI) external {
        bytes32 songHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(songName, artistName)); // Generate a unique song hash
        require(!existingSongs[songHash], "This song is already registered as an NFT");

        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        uint256 newTokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();

        _mint(msg.sender, newTokenId);
        _setTokenURI(newTokenId, metadataURI);

        songDetails[newTokenId] = Song(songName, artistName, block.timestamp);
        existingSongs[songHash] = true;
        _mintedTokens[newTokenId] = true; // Mark token as minted

        emit MusicMinted(msg.sender, newTokenId, songName, artistName, block.timestamp);
    }

    /// @notice Retrieve song details by NFT ID
    /// @param tokenId The NFT token ID
    /// @return songName, artistName, and timestamp of minting
    function getSongDetails(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory, string memory, uint256) {
        require(_mintedTokens[tokenId], "Token ID does not exist");
        Song memory song = songDetails[tokenId];
        return (song.songName, song.artistName, song.timestamp);
    }
}
```

### **How the Smart Contract Works:**
1. **Artists Call `mintMusicNFT()`**  
   - Provide **song name, artist name, and metadata URI** (stored on IPFS).
   - A **new NFT is minted** and linked to their Ethereum wallet.
   - Prevents duplicate registrations of the same song.
   - Emits an **event with the NFT details**.

2. **Ownership Verification**  
   - `getSongDetails(tokenId)` allows **anyone** to verify the song‚Äôs **original creator and timestamp**.

3. **Secure & Immutable Data**  
   - Since blockchain records cannot be altered, **ownership is permanent**.
   - Storing the **metadata URI** ensures details (e.g., song file, album cover) remain accessible.

## **Deployment Steps**
1. **Set Up a Blockchain Environment**  
   - Use **Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)** or **Polygon Mumbai** for deployment.  
   - Install **MetaMask** for wallet integration.  
   - Use **Remix IDE** for contract deployment.  

2. **Deploy the Smart Contract**  
   - Compile the contract using Remix or Hardhat.
   - Deploy on **Sepolia Testnet** using **Alchemy or Infura**.
   - Verify the contract on **Etherscan**.

3. **Store Metadata on IPFS**
   - Use **Pinata** or **Filecoin** to store song metadata.

4. **Build a Simple UI (Optional)**  
   - A frontend using **React + Web3.js** can be built for artists to mint NFTs easily.
